# Installing linter SonarLint in IDE

Sonar Lint is a free, open-source linting tool. A linting tool/linter is a software tool which, when integrated with an IDE, can provide increased feedback to the developer.

Traditional IDE tools utilize built-in linters to identify code syntax errors, and exceptions. Sonar Lint provides further suggestions by recognizing code smells.

## Code Quality Analysis and Code Smells

Code Quality Analysis tools are programs specifically designed to expose errors as well as 'code smells'.

Code Smells

-   Vulnerabilities
    -   Data security issues
-   Bugs
    -   Issues with functionality of code
-   Maintainability issues
    -   Confusing or hard to maintain code
    -   Repeated instances of code
    -   Unused imports
    -   Empty code blocks
    -   Unaddressed automated code comments

Or you can intall it directly in the ide from the the customize panel on the left when you first open the ide

Search for the SonarLint plugin, install it, then restart your IDE

# Java Exceptions

Are events that occur during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow, during these events an Exception object is thrown

-   You can recover from exception if you handle them

# Exceptions class hierarchy

The root of all exceptions is the Throwable class

-   Any class that extends this Throwable class is able to be "thrown" with the `throw` keyword

The Exception class and Error class that both extend Throwable

RuntimeException that extends Exception

From there, all exception extend either from the Exception or RuntimeException class

# Checked vs Unchecked Exceptions

Checked exceptions are caught at compile time, and they are required to be handled by the programmer, otherwise your code will not run

-   In the hierarchy these are the classes NOT extending RuntimeException

Examples:

-   FileNotFoundException
-   ClassNotFoundException
-   CloneNotSupportedException

Unchecked Exceptions are caught during run-time, are not required to be handled by the programmer

-   In the hierarchy these are any exceptions that ARE a subclass of RunTimeException

Examples:

-   ArithmeticException
-   IndexOutOfBoundsException
-   NullPointerException

In Java there are also objects called Errors, these occur when something goes carstrophically wrong, and cannot be recovered from

Examples:

-   StackOverflow
-   OutOfMemory

# Handling or declaring checked exceptions

When you suspect that code may be at risk of throwing exception, it can be handled in two ways

1. You place the code inside of a try/catch block
2. You can declare the method could throw an exception with the `throws` keyword

-   Declaring it on the method will "duck" the exception, which hands the responisibility of handling the exception to which every entity called the exception

## try/catch/finally blocks:

You want to enclose the code that is suspect to throw an error inside of the try block of code

Inside of the parenthesis of the catch block, you should declare the exception that you are expecting to catch, and whatever logic should run if the exception occurs

The finally block will run regardless of the out of the try block

try/catch rules and multi-catch blocks

-   Multiple catches are aloud, but they must go from most specific to least specific
-   You can catch more than one exception per catch block using ||
-   The finally is optional
-   A try/finally block is legal, but a try block on its own is not

You can cause an exception yourself by using the `throw` keyword

# Custom Execeptions

You can also create your own custom exceptions

-   You can create checked exceptions by extending the Exception class
-   You can create unchecked exceptions by extending the RuntimeException class

Which one you choose depends in whether you want to force the programmer to handle the exception

# Test for exceptions using Junit

In JUnit you can test for if an exception is thrown in a test by using `@Test(expected = Exception.class) to the test.

If the expection is thrown the test will pass, if the exception is no thrown, but you will included @Expected the test will fail

# Generics

Generics are constructs introduced in Java 5 which enforce compile time type safety by allowing you to use parameterized types

-   They are used heavily with the Collections API

They are essentially a place holder for a future datatype that helps us enforce type safety

Generics can be declared on a class, method parameters, or return types

With Generics you can restrict a class to only accept objects of a given type and the compiler will prevent you from using any other types

To make a class or interface generic, use angled brackets when declaring it, and use an arbitrary "generic type" which is determined by invoking the code

Naming conventions for Generics

-   E => Element
-   K => Map Key
-   V => Map Value
-   N => Number
-   T => Generic Data type
-   S, U, V and so => For multiple generic data types

# Data structure:

a data organization, management, and storage format that enables effiecient access and modification

-   Each one prioritizes access and modification in different
-   Typically one is better for specific tasks for others

There are two different types of data structures:

-   Linear: arranged in an orderly manner where each element is attached adjacently
    -   Elements can ve access in one time single run
    -   Simplier to implement
    -   single level
    -   Memory inefficient
-   Hierarchical: arranges elements in a sorted order, adn there is a relationship between them
    -   Cannot be accessed in a single run
    -   Complex to implement
    -   Multi-leveled
    -   Memory Efficient

Java implements many of the linear structures in the Collection API

# Collection Framework

The Collection API is a framework of Java classes and interfaces that implement commonly used data structures

**ALMOST** every class in the collections api extends from the Iterable interface

-   Exception is the Map classes

# Iterable Interable and Iterator Interface

## Iterable Interface:

defines data structures that can be directly traversed using the .iterator() method

## Interator Interface:

contains methods for traversing linear data structures, these methods include:

-   hasNext()
-   next()
-   remove()

Any class that implements Iterable can also be used with enhanced for-loops

Classes that implement the Iterable interface also have the .forEach() each method, which allows user to iterate through the data structure, and perform some logic with a lamda expression

# Implementations of Collection Interfaces

## Lists

The most basic datatype, a collection of ordered data that is preserved

-   Duplicate entries are allowed
-   Elements are accessed by their index, which start at 0

ArrayList: a concrete implementation of the List interface that contains an array within it

-   The array is resizable, once it reaches the max capacity it increases its size by 50%
-   You can traverse it quickly via index
-   Insertion and deltion is slower, because it may have to resive the internal array

LinkedList: a concrete implementation of the List and Queue interface which is composed of nodes that reference each other

-   Insertion and deletion is relatively quick
-   Traverse to a specific index is slower

Vector: an older concrete implementation of the List interface, which is a threadsafe arraylist

-   Doubles in size if needed

Stack: an older concrete implementation of the List interface, used to implement the stack data structure, (first in last out), but you should now use ArrayDeque

## Sets

A collection of data that is not ordered and does not allow duplicate elements

-   does not preserve the order in which elements are inserted

HashSet: a concrete implementation fo the Set interface backed by a HashMap

-   There is no ordering when iterating
-   Allows one null value
-   Allows fast insertion and traveral

TreeSet: a concerete implementation of the Set interface which maintains sorted order when elements are inserted

-   It is backed by a Sorted Tree
-   Insertion and deletion is slow
-   It cannot contain null elements

## Queues

Collection of data that follows first in first out, unless otherwise specified

ArrayDeque: a concrete implementation of the Queue interface that allows programmers to implement stack or queue behavior

-   It is a double ended queue
-   It stores items in a resizable array

Useful ArrayDeque methods:

-   pop()
-   push()
-   peekFirst()
-   peekLast()
-   pollFirst()
-   pollLast()
-   offerFirst()
-   offerLast()

Priority Queue: a concrete implementation of the Queue interface which orders elements based on their natural ordering

-   It uses a Comparator to order the elements

## Maps

Data structure that uses key/value pairs to store and retrieve data

The Map interface does not implement the Collection Interface, however it is still considered to be part of the Collections API

You cannot iterate over a Map, because it does not implement the iterable interface, you can iterate through different values in a Map:

-   use the entrySet() method to iterate over the set of Map.entry
-   use keySet() method to iterate over the set of keys
-   use values() method to return a Collection of values which then can be iterated over

HashMap: a concrete implementation of the Maps interface that:

-   Stores elements in a key/value pair
-   Insertion and retreival is fast
-   Tradeoff is that it does not maintain insetion order
-   Permits on null key and null values

TreeMap: a concrete implementation of the Maps interface that:

-   Stores its keys in a sorted tree structure
-   Insertion and retrieval is slow
-   Cannot contain null keys

HashTable: older concrete implementation of the Maps interface that is threadsage, and cannot contain null keys or values

# Comparable and Comparator Interfaces

## Comparable:

an interface which defines the natual ordering for a class

-   The class must implement the Comparabl interface and implement the compareTo() method

The compareTo() method should return:

-   Zero id the two object are equal
-   Less than zero if "this" object is smaller than the one in the parameter list
-   Greater than zero is "this" object is larger than the one in the parameter list

## Comparator

an interface that allows you to define a total ordering on some collection of objects

-   You can implement the Comparator interface, but are not required to implement the .compare() method

# collections vs Collection vs Collections

-   collections are just a collection of entities
-   Collection: is an interface within the Collection API
-   Collections: is a utility class that has static, conveient methods that operate on data structures in the Collections API

# Threads and Concurency

Concurency refers to breaking up a task into different parts that can be executed independent of one another, in any order without affecting the final outcome

## Threads:

a thread is a subset of a process that is also an independent sequence of execution

-   Threads of the main process wil run in the same memory space, but managed independently by the scheduler

Every thread has its own call stack where it stores local variable references, but since they share the same heap memory multiple threads can access the same objects in memory

Mutlithreading is the idea of using multiple threads in an application to achieve parallelism

-   Each thread can perform its own task increasing effiency

In Java we achieve multi-threading with the Thread class and the Runnable interface

In general it is best practice to not attemp to implement multithreading on your own, because it can lead to issues we will speak about later

-   You are encouraged to use frameworks and api's that implement it for you

# States of Threads

Threads follow a lifecycle with six different states:

1. New: newly created thread that has not started executing
2. Runnable: either running or ready for execution but waiting for its resource allocation
3. Blocked: waiting to acquirea monitor lock to enter or re-enter a synchronized block/method
4. Waiting: waiting for some other thread to perform an action
5. Timed_Waiting: waiting for some other thread to perfom a specific action for a specific time
6. Terminated: has completed its execution

![Thread lifecycle](https://www.javatpoint.com/images/thread-life-cycle.png)

Threads also have priorities which signify which order that should be run. The thread class contains a few static variables for priority

-   MIN_PRIORITY = 1
-   NORM_PRIORITY = 5, default
-   MAX_PRIORITY = 10

# Custom Threads

You can create your own custom threads in one of two ways, extending the Thread class, or implementing the Runnable interface

## Thread Class

Creating a thread with extending the Thread class will grant you access to the thread classes methods:

-   getters and setters for id, name, and priority
-   interrupt() to explicitly interupt the thread
-   isAlive, isInterrupted, and isDaemon to test the state of the thread
-   join() to wait for the thread to finish executing
-   start() to actually begin the thread execution after instatantion

To create a thread this way:

1. Create a class that extends Thread
2. Implement the run() method
3. Use the custom thread with the .start() method

## Runnable Interface

Creating a thread with implementing the Runnable interface will give you the freedom to extend any different class of your liking

To create a thread in this way:

1. Create a class that implements Runnable
2. Implement the run() method
3. To use this thread you must create a generic thread object and pass your custom runnable object as a parameter to the constructor

# Thread Problems

There are issues that can occur if you try to implement multithreading yourself. Once of these is called Deadlock

Deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocked trying to access the same resource, waiting for one another. Neither thread can continue execution, so the program halts indefinitely. This it where Synchronization comes in

Synchronization is the capability to control the access of multiple threads to any shared resource

To do this we use the `synchronized` keyword. The synchronized keyword enforces that only one thread can access the resource at a given time

Another problem multithreaded programs run into is the producer consumer problem

# Producer Consumer Problem

In this problem we have a fixed size buffer that is shared between the producer and the consumer

-   The producer adds to the buffer
-   The consumer takes from the buffer

The proble is that data should only be added if the buffer is not full, and data should only be consumed if the buffer is not empty

To solve this we can use the synchronized keyword, as well as the .wait() and .notify() methods to communicate across threads

-   .wait() can pause the consumer depending on the amount of data in the buffer
-   .notify() can send a notification to either thread when they can be used
