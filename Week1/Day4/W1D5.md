# Garbage Collection

Java automatically removes objects from memory where there is no longer a reference to it

You cannot explicitly call for garbage collection, but you can suggest it with these methods

-   System.gc()
-   Runtime.getRuntime().gc()
-   System.runFinalize()
    -   Finalize is an inherited method from the object class, you can override it to implement some logic to run before you object is destroyed

# Java 8 Features

Java 8 implemented many new and useful features including:

-   Functional Interfaces
-   Lamda Expressions
-   Stream API
-   Reflections API
-   Date and Time API
-   Optional Classses
-   Predicates

# Lambda and Functional Interfaces

Functional interfaces are interfaces with only one abstract method

-   Implicitly created by lamdas
-   Can explicitly be created for use by lambdas

Lamdas possibly the biggest addition to Java 8, they introduce important aspects of functional programming, allow for dismebodied methods, aka functions

The basic syntax is `paramters(s) -> expression`

For multiple paramaters parenthesis are required, for multiple lines of logic in the expression curly braces

The return keyword is optional

# Default keyword for interfaces

Java 8 added the ability for developers to add implementations to methods inside of interfaces

If you use the keyword `default` in an interface, you can implement a method of an interface

# Introduction to OWASP Top 10

The OWASP top 10 are the most critical security risks to web applications

-   OWASP stands for Open Web Application Security Project, and it is a non-profit foundation dedicated to improving the security of software.

The OWASP top two are important to know because they give organizations a priority over which risks to focus on and help them understand, identify, and fix vulnerabilities in their technology.

# OWASP - Insufficient Logging and Monitoring

Insuffiecient logging is just as it sounds, either not, or not frequently logging and monitoring those logs of an application

Logging is the recording of a "log" of certain events that occur in the life of the application (more on logging soon)

Monitoring is actually looking through the logs of the application, aka "monitoring" in order to take action if neccessary

## How attackers can take advantage of Insufficient Logging and Monitoring

If for example an attacker has a list of 100 usernames of users on your application, they can try to log into each of those accounts using a script that also holds 1000's of commonly used passwords

-   We should be logging things like when a users login attempt is unsuccessful, and we should be monitoring the logs to see when things like this are happening
-   In the case of the attacker, they may get away with stealing these users information, but it we look in the logs we might notice a ton of failed login attempts and realize there was an attack

On average data breaches take between 160 and 200 days to detect. This means that the attacker has several months to illegally obtain information about users. But we can detect these things master if we monitor our logs closely

## Consdier this when logging

Sufficient Content: When you look at the log, you know exactly what's going on, but theres no unnecessary info that hackers could use

Good Format: Organized format that easily readible/consumable. Too much content is not a good thing

Integrity controls: These will usually be in place if you ever send your log file to an external source, or even save it locally. If the log content ever gets changed, you want to be notified that the integrity of the data isn't there anymore. Either a nefarious acteor changed something or data was corrupted during transfer

Response Plan: You can monitor you logs all you want, but you need to actually be able to act on suspicous activity you've spotted

# Creational Design Patterns

Creational Design patterns are meant to solve commonly occuring software development problems

## Singleton:

a design pattern which allows the creation of an object only once in an application

-   This object is then shared across mulitple classes
-   Useful for things like data base connections, or other services

There are two main types of singletons you may see

-   Lazy, the actual singleton object is not created until it is actually needeed
-   Eager, the actual singleton object is created as soon as its loaded into memory

The difference between these two is when the constructor is called in the class.

In an eager singleton, the constructor is called and singleton object is created first thing in the class

In a lazy singleton, the constructor is called in a mutator method to get the single instance of the object

## Factory Design Pattern:

design pattern that creates objects in which the precise type may not be known until runtime

## Builder Design Pattern:

a design pattern similar to factory, however it creates more concrete objects, think of the StringBuilder we used previously, this is an implimentation of the Builder Design Pattern

# Logging with Log4J

Logging records events that occur during the execution of your program

-   They allow for developers to access information about application for which they do not have direct access
-   Without logs developers would have no idea what went wrong when the application crashes

We will being using Log4j for logging

-   Log4j is a reliable, fast, and flexible logging framework for Java supported by apache
-   It is commonly used to record application events, log granular debugging information, and write exception events to files

Log4J allows us to use various logging levels, and configurable thresholds that determine which messages will be recorded in the application log file

Log4j Logging Levels:

1. ALL => all levels
2. DEBUG => designated for fine graned informational events that are most useful to debug an application
3. INFO => informational messages that highlight the progress of the application at the coarse grained level
4. WARN => designates pottentially harmful situations
5. ERROR => designates error events that might still allow the application to continue running
6. FATAL => severe error events that presumably lead the application to crash
7. OFF => highest possible level, intended to turn off logging
