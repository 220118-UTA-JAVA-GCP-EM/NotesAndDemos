# Java OOP Inheritance

Inheritance is were a base class (or parent class) passes traits/behaviors down to a sub-class (or child class)

-   This creates a parent-child or is-a relationship between two classes

In Java all non-private fields and methods are inherited from a parent class by using the keyword extends in the class declaration

Inheritance is useful because:

-   It allows code to be more reusable and modular
-   It helps avoid boilerplate (redundant) code, helping us abide by the common programming guidline DRY (don't repeat yourself)

Shadowing:

-   the practice in Java programming of having two variables with the same name within scopes that overlap
    -   When this happens the higher-level scope is hidden because the variable with lower level scope overrides it
    -   The higher level variable is now shadowed
-   When a parent and child share the same variable, the childs will shadow the parents

In Java there is no multiple inheritance via classes, meaning one class can only ever extend one other class

-   This is because two different classes can have the same method, and the sub class would not know implementation to use

However, classes in Java are allowed to implement any number of interfaces, making multiple inheritance possible through interfaces

-   This is because interfaces don't care what implemenation you give them, as long as the method is implemented in the subclass

# Object Class

In Java the object class is the root of all class from which all other classes inherit

Therefore, all classes in Java will have these methods defined by the Object class:

-   Object clone()
-   boolean equals(Object o): by default this will perform == on the objects memory location, you can override this to compare other parts of the object
-   void finalize(): this is called by the garbage collector when it determines there are no more references to the object
-   Class<?> getClass()
-   int hashCode(): returns an int indicating the hashcode, this one has a few rules
    -   If you override equals() you are also expected to override hashCode()
    -   The result of hashCode() should not change in a program
    -   if .equals() returns true the hashcode should be the same
    -   if .equals() returns false, the hashcodes do not have to be distinct
-   void notify()
-   void notifyAll()
-   String toString(): this will be called automatically if you try to print the object, typically you want to override this method otherwise it will print the fully qualified class name
-   void wait()
-   void wait(long timeout)
-   void wait(long timeout, int nanos)

# Java OOP Abstraction

Abstraction is a programming principle in which we centralize common characteristics and generalize behavior into conceptual classes

With abstraction you hide the underlying copmlexity through a simplified interface

Essentially hiding how something functions, but still allows users to know what its functions are

In java abstraction is done through abstract classes and interfaces

## Abstract Classes

Abstract classes are more general classes that cannot be instatiated, they act as templates for other classes to inherit

Abstract classes are created with the abstract keyword, and can contain both concrete and abstract methods

## Interfaces

Interfaces are contracts for methods that classes must implement, they also cannot be instantiated

Interfaces are implicitly public and abstract

-   Every method in an interface is public and abstract
-   Interfaces can have variables, they will implicitly be public static and final
-   In Java 8 default methods were added, which allow programmers to implement methods in an interface

To inherit from an interface a class must use te implements keyword in the class declaration

## Marker Interfaces

A marker interface is an interface that contains no methods or constants, its sould purpose is to provide runtime information to the compiler. Examples of this are Serializable, and Cloneable

# Java OOP Polymorphism

Polymorphism is the ability for an object to take on many forms

The most common ways this is achieved is:

-   Method overloading
-   Method overriding
-   covariance
-   casting

Method Overloading:

-   Two or more methods exist with the same name, but have different method signatures by changing the parameter list

You can change the number of parameters, the types of the parameters, or the order in which the parameters are passed

-   The return type must stay the same
-   Which method runs is determined at run-time, making it run-time polymorphism

Method Overriding:

-   A method in a child class has the same name as a method in the parent class, but a different implementation

Overriding methods makes class hierarchies more flexible and dynamic

Method overriding is a form of runtime polymorphism because of virtual method invocation

-   Virtual Method Invocation will look at the reference objects type and call the method associated with that object

If a subclass implements the same static method as its parent, the method is hidden. Method hiding replaces the parent method in the calls defined in the child class

Covariant Return Type:

-   When overriding a method you can change the return type as long as it is a subclass of the original return type
-   You can change the access modifier as long as it is not more restrictive

## Casting

Upcasting allows you to assign a child object to a parent object, this works because the child will have all of the behaviors of the parent, however you may be missing some of the childs functionality

Downcasting is the opposite, it allows you to assign a parent object to a child object, however you cannot garentee that the parent object will have all the properties of the child leading to problems

# Scanner Class

The scanner class in Java is used to scan input. It can be used to take in user input from the command line.

To use it import the scanner class was Java utils, then create a new scanner, with System.in to take in user input

# Annotations

# Annotations

Annotations are special constructs in Java which use the @ symbol followed by the name of the annotation

-   Annotations provide metadata about the source code to the compiler and JVM

Annotations can be placed over classes, methods, interfaces, and other constructs

Annotations are often used by libraries to abstract funcionality, or enforce some set of rules

-   Annotations are ofect processed by the Reflections API

Some examples include:

-   @Override
-   @Deprecated
-   @SuppressWarnings
-   @FunctionalInterface

# Intro to TDD and Unit Testing

Test Driven Development (TDD) is a the process of writing tests for your code, then implementing the code to pass those tests

-   This helps increase code coverage

## Red/Green Testing

Red/Green testing is typically associated with TTD, and it is the process of writing a test before the code which results in red, writing the code to pass the specific test (green), then rewrite/create a new test that fails (red), refactor your code to pass (green), and so on until you have reached your ideal functionality

The process can be broken down into 5 steps

1. Write a unit test
2. Run the test (it will fail)
3. Write code to pass the test
4. Retest, until the test passes
5. Repeat the process

# Unit Tests

Unit Testing: is the testing of individual software components in isolation from the rest of the software

It cal also be known as White Box testing:

-   a testing method in which the internal design of the item being tested is known to the tester

Unit testing can find if/where something goes wrong in your code

-   This helps reduce debugging time because you know where to look for the issue in the code
-   It also increases code coverage, because you should be testing each individual unit/module of code
-   It increases confidence in changinf and maintaining your code base

It is best practice to include both positive and negative test cases

# JUnit and Mockito

## JUnit: is a Java framework for unit testing

It uses annotations to create tests and setup testing enviornments

-   `@Test` - declares a method as a test method
-   `@BeforeClass` - declares a setup method that runs once, before all other methods in the class
-   `@Before` - declares a setup method that runs before each test method
-   `@After` - declares a tear-down method that runs before each test method
-   `@AfterClass` - declares a tear-down method that runs once, after all other methods in the class

JUnit also has built in methods to use in your testing methods to verify the state of the application is what is expected:

-   `assertTrue()`
-   `assertFalse()`
-   `assertEquals()`
-   `assertNotEquals()`
-   `assertThat()`

# Mockito: is Java framework that allows us to mock the functionality of other methods

-   This allows for black box testing:
    -   Where you don't know the functionality of a given item, we just need the output
-   This is extremely useful for testing methods that rely on the output of other methods
-   You replace the depedency of the other method with mocks and stubs

A stub is a fake class that comes with preprogrammed return values

A mock is a fake class that can be examined after the test is finished to see how it interacted with the class under the test

## Mocking Objects w Mockito

Mockito uses annotations to implement its mocking, to mock an object you put `@Mock` above it

-   Mocking an object gives you the ability to prevent the object from doing something, and just tell it what to do
-   This is useful when one piece of code relies on another module, you can have a garenteed return from the dependent module by using mocking

If you have an object that requires other modules, you can use `@InjectMocks` above the object to give it the dependencies needed

Finally, to be sure the mocking is going to work, you will need to enable the Mockito annotations, to do this you can create a method to run before the test suite with `@Before` and inside of that method call `MockitoAnnotations.openMocks(this)`

# Introduction to Gradle

Gradle is fast, flexible, general purpose build tool that allows developers to build any software. It's task and plugin model allow developers to create custom workflows or use pre-canned workflows.

Gradle scripts are written in Groovey or Kotlin which gives full java API exposure to write tasks that can perform any OS task

## Features of Gradle

High Performance: Gradle uses hashing methods to compare the inputs and outputs of tasks and only rerun tasks that have changed. Build caching can be used to reuse task outputs from previous runs or remote machines with shared build cache.

JVM Foundation: Gradle runs on the Java platform and requires a JDK to be installed. Build scripts are written in [Groovy](https://groovy-lang.org), a JVM language, which exposes the standard Java API for use in task build logic.

Conventions: Gradle follows a `convention over configuration` ideaology. Gradle follows Maven's lead and makes common project types such Java projects easy to build. With the use of plugins, developers can reduce the size and complexity of build scripts.

Extensibility: Gradle is easily extensible. Developers can provide their own custom tasks, plugins, and build models.

IDE Support: Most major, modern IDEs are shipped with Gradle integration making it even easier to create, test, build, and deploy applications with full IDE integration.

Insight: Gradle build scans provide extensive information on build runs that can help identify issues.

# Install Gradle

# Gradle Build Scripts

Gradle builds consist of one or more projects. The definition of a project in Gradle is dependent on what Gradle is being used to do. A project could be building a JAR or other type of distributable, generating documentation, performing deployment process, etc.

The work that is done in a project is performed by one or more task. A task is a single, atomic unit of work which a build performs. A task would be a single step in a project like compile classes or run unit tests or build jar.

A script is file that the Gradle daemon looks for in the current directory. By default all Gradle configured directories have a file name `build.gradle` which is the script or build configuration script.

# Managing Dependencies with Gradle

In the gradle build script we have a section called `dependencies`

The dependecies configuration block of the build script defines the different modules that will be used in the project. To add a new dependency to the project, simply add it to the dependcy configuration block. The most common type of dependency is a module dependency. A module dependency is a dependency that exist in a repository like Maven Central, JFrog Center, or Google.

## Depedency Declarations

We can declare a dependency in three different ways in gradle

1. implementation -- dependencies that are used to compile the production source which are not part of the exposed API. This build script uses hibernate for internal persistence.
2. api -- (java-library plugin) dependencies that are used to compile production source which will be exposed in the application API. This build script uses guava and will use guava classes and interfaces in its method signatures. This is useful in multi-project builds where this project would be consumed by another as an API.
3. testImplementation -- dependency required to compile and run the test sources.

# Create a Gradle Project with the command line

1. Create a folder to store the folder
2. Open up git bash in the folder in which we would like to create the gradle project
3. We will run the command `gradle init`
4. Choose the following options to setup our java project
    - Select Type of project to generate > 2
    - Select implemenation language > 3
    - Split functionality across multiple subprojects? > 1
    - Select build script DSL > 1
    - Generate build using new API's ... > no
    - Select test framework > 1
    - Project name > NameItWhaterYouNamedYourFolder
    - Source package > com.example
