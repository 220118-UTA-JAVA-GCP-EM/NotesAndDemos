# Constructors

Special methods that declare how an object is to be instantiated and initialized from their class

-   They do not have a return type
-   They return a new object

There are three types of constructors:

1. `default` gets created automatically when no other constructor is given in the class
2. `argument(s)` a constructor that takes in any number of parameters
3. `no-arg` a constructor that takes in no parameters, must be created by the programmer

No-arg and default are not the same, if you create a no-args constructor it will replace the default constructor

## The `this` keyword typically is used to set a variable that belongs to the specific class/object

## The `this()` keyword inside of the constructor to call another constructor in the current class, used to chain constructors

## The `super()` keyword is used to call the constructor of the classes parent class, it is implicitly called on the first line of every constructor

# Strings and the String Pool

Strings are immutable, constant objects derived from the String class, the String object store sequences of characters as their value

Immutable means the state or value cannot be changed once the object is created

Strings are NOT primitives they are objects

All String methods return a new String object, the original is not modifed

The reason Strings are immutable are because of the String pool in memory

## String Pool:

a place in memory where strings are placed when created

-   This is stored in the Heap
-   Duplicate Strings are not allowed
-   If a String literal exists in the pool, any new matching String literal will point to the existing String in the pool

If you want to create a duplicate, you can create a new String object that will exist in the heap

-   If the string literal being used to create the object does not exist in the pool, it will be added

# StringBuilder and StringBuffer

StringBuilder and StringBuffer allow us to create mutable strings

-   Are mutable classes that hold a sequence of characters

They both have methods such as .append() and .insert() which mutates their internal sequence of characters

StringBuilder is not threadsafe, and StringBuffer is threadsafe

# Wrapper Classes

For every Primitive in Java, there is a wrapper class with the same name but capitalized

-   These allow you to treat primitives as objects

The Wrapper Classes include:

| Primitive | Wrapper Class |
| --------- | ------------- |
| boolean   | Boolean       |
| byte      | Byte          |
| short     | Short         |
| char      | Character     |
| int       | Integer       |
| long      | Long          |
| float     | Float         |
| double    | Double        |

Autoboxing: when you pass a primitive argument into a parameter that asks for its wrapper equivalent, Java will automatically wrap the primitive into its object type

Unboxing: when you pass a wrapper object into a parameter that asks for a primitive, Java will automatically convert the object to a primitive

# Packages and Imports

Packages are a way to organize your classes, interfaces, and enums into a folder structure

-   They follow the lowercase naming convention, with words separated by dots, in the reversee way you would call a web domain
-   com.example.package

You can access classes by their fully qualified names eg. package.classname

You can use import statements to pull in other classes

After importing the class or package we can just use it in the program
The java.lang package is imported by defaulted

# Java Operators

| Operator             | Precedence                              |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| postfix              | x++ x--                                 |
| prefix               | ++x --x                                 |
| multiplicative       | \* / %                                  |
| additive             | + -                                     |
| shift                | << >> >>>                               |
| relational           | < > <= >=                               |
| equality             | == !=                                   |
| bitwise AND          | &                                       |
| bitwise exclusive OR | ^                                       |
| bitwise OR           | \|                                      |
| logical AND          | &&                                      |
| logical OR           | \|\|                                    |
| ternary              | expression ? true option : false option |
| assignment           | = += -= /= %=                           |

When we talk about logical AND

true && true = true
true && false = false
false && true = false
false && false = false

When we talk about logical OR

true || true = true
true || false = true
false || true = true
false || false = false

## Logical AND and OR will short circuit

-   the operation can determine the outcome by looking at only one side of the expression

# Arrays, VarArgs, and for-each loops

An array is a contigous block of memory storing a group of sequential elements of the same type

-   Arrays are of a fixed size, and cannot be resized
-   Arrays are declared with square brackets after the data type
-   Arrays are referenced via their index inside of the square bracket notation
    -   Indexes start at 0
    -   There is also a length property that specifies the length of the array

Arrays can also be multi-dimensional, you use multiple square brackets instead one

-   This store arrays insides of an arrays, forms a matrix like structure

VarArgs is short for variable arguments, and it is used to set an argument to a method whose size is determined at runtime

-   You use the ... notation instead of the array bracket notation
-   Java will convert this to an array under the hood, so you access the arguments the same way you would an array
-   There can only be one varargs, and it must be the last parameter

for-each is what we consider an enhanced for loop, it allows us to simply loop through all of the content of an array, or other data structure. We do not need to include and of the looping variables like a normal for loop

# Java Control Flow:

We can break up the normal of an application with conditional/branching statements and loops

Conditional/Branching:

-   if/else, if/else if, ternary operators, switch, try catch

Looping Statements:

-   for loops, enchanced for loops, while loops, and do-while loops

Conditional Statements run when a condition evalutates to true, or skips if its false

-   You can use if statements three ways
    -   single if
    -   if/else
    -   if/else if
-   Switch statements can conditionally check the equality of objects/variables
    -   They take a variable and attempt to match its content
    -   Only work with byte, char, short, int, String, and enums

Loop Statements repeat logic until the loop is finished

-   for loops run the logic inside for a set number of times
-   while loops runs the logic inside until a condition is false
-   do-while loop runs the logic inside of the while loop while a condition is true, expect it will always run at least once

## Break and Continue Keywords

Break can be used in loops, if statements, and switch statements

-   It will break out of the current block of code

Continue can only be used inside of loops

-   It will break out of the current iteration of the loop, and return to the top of the loop execution

# Java OOP Overview

OOP stands for Object Oriented Programming, there are four pillars of OOP that you need to know

Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, and Encapsulation

Abstaction is hiding the detail of implemenation, while still providing the user access to the functionality

Polymorphism is the ability for an object to take many forms

Inheritance is the ability for an object to take on states and behaviors from a parent object

Encapsulation is hiding data, while making it available through mutators.

# Java OOP Encapsulation

Encapsulation in Java used Access Modifers to hide information inside of classes.

We use mutators, which are methods available to every other class to share the states that we want, while hiding the sensitive states that should not be shared

We typically denote these mutators as methods called getters and setter, getters will return the data from hidden variable inside of a class, setters will set the value of a hidden variable inside of a class

# Modifiers

There are two types of modifiers, access and non-access

## Access Modifiers:

are keywords that define the ability of other code to access the given entity

There are 4 access modifiers, and they can be placed in front of classes, interfaces, enums and class members

-   public: available anywhere
-   protected: available within the same package, and this class' sub-classes
-   default(nothing): available within the same package
-   private: only available within the class

## Non-access Modifiers

There are 7, but we only use 4 often

-   static: is the keyword to denote that a class member has class scope, can be used on variables and methods
    -   static variables can be accessed through the class eg MyClass.staticVariable
    -   static methods can be called directly without needing an of the class, eg. MyClass.someMethod()
-   final: is the keyword that makes something unchangable
    -   when applied to a variable it cannot be reassigned
    -   when applied to a class it cannot be extended
    -   when applied to a method it cannot be overriden
-   abstract:
    -   when applied to a class, the class can no longer be instantiated directly, it must be inherited
    -   when applied to a method, the method must not have an implementation, any abstract method must be in an abstract class
-   transient:
    -   mark a variable as non-serializable, meaning it will not be persisted when written to a byte stream

# Variable Scopes

When a variable is declared in Java, it is attached to specific scope within the program, which determines where the variable resides

The different scopes are:

-   Instance of object:
    -   The variable belongs to an individual object created from a class
    -   When an instance varible is modified it has no effect on other objects of the same class
-   Class or static scope:
    -   The variable belongs to the class itself, every object of that class share this variable
    -   When a class variable is modified, the varible in all objects of that class is also changed
-   Method:
    -   The variable was created inside of a method block, so it is only available inside of that method
    -   Will no longer exist after the method has finished
-   Block:
    -   The variable only exists within a specific block of code
    -   A block of code is any code with {}
    -   Most typically if/else, for loops, while loops, after these are done executing the variable no longer exists

# Order of Initalization

When Java is initializing classes there is an order of initialization, the order is the following

1. Static fields/variables
2. Static initializers
3. Instance fields/variables
4. Instance initializers
5. Constructors

# POJO vs Bean

A POJO is a Plain Old Java Object

-   We have been creating these all week

A Java Bean is a special Java Object with specific rules

-   All Java Beans are POJO's but not all POJO's are Java Beans
-   They must be serializable, i.e. implement the Serializable interface
-   All fields should be private
-   Fields should have getters and setters
-   There should be a no-args constructor
-   Fields are acceesed only by constructors or getters and setters
