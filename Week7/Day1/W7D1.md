# Data lifecycle overview

The data in our system goes through a set of steps we call the data lifecycle

The exact amount of steps, and exactly what those steps are differ depending on who you ask, but there is still a basic overview

1. Data Collection: We are going to get data from somewhere

2. Data Processing: We are going to process the data and get it into a form where we can store it

3. Data Storage: We want to store the data for later use and analysis

4. Analysis / Interpretation: Finally we can use the data that has been collected and stored to analysize and use for our applications/businesses

# OLTP

Online Transaction Processing

Data processing that consists of executing a number of transactions occurring concurrently

-   Online Banking
-   Online Shopping

Traditionally these transacations are stored for enterprises to later look through for record keeping/data analysis

Online transaction processing typically involves inserting, updating, and/or deleting small amounts of data in a data store to collect, manage, and secure the transactions in question

## OLTP System Features

Real-time execution of large numbers of database transactions by large numbers of people

Lightning-fast response times

Modify small amounts of data frequently and usually involve a balance of reads and writes

Use indexed data to improve response times

Require frequent or concurrent database backups

Require relatively little storage space

Usually run simple queries involving just one or a few records

# Requirements for a OLTP System

The most common architecture of an OLTP system that uses transactional data is a three-tier architecture that typically consists of a presentation tier, a business logic tier, and a data store tier. The presentation tier is the front end, where the transaction originates via a human interaction or is system-generated. The logic tier consists of rules that verify the transaction and ensure all the data required to complete the transaction is available. The data store tier stores the transaction and all the data related to it.

The system must adhere to the ACID properties

Must be able to handle thousands of users accessing data concurently

Must be scalable, some points the number of active users will be lower than other points in time

Must be available 24/7

Must be allow high throughput and short response times

Must be reliable

Must be secure

And must be recoverable

The database that best fits this type of system is a relational database management system

# Data sources - deep dive

Data: anything that we can quantify (a.k.a. not always numeric)

-   figures, numbers, texts, puctyures, values, dates, etc
-   if you can store it in a database it's data
    -   but also more:
        -   files
        -   images
        -   videos

## Where do we get this data?

Short answer, anywhere

When it comes to businesses, data can come from their personal sales numbers, research, and projections.

Data can also be scraped off of the web using web crawlers

Data can come from preexisting databases that one may have access to

Data can come from files, such as json, excel, or even csv files

All of these sources can give us valuable data that can be extracted and stored for our own personal benefit

# Database Vendors

There are many different providers of vendors of RDBMS systems, including:

Oracle
PostgreSQL (or just "Postgres")
MySQL
Microsoft SQLServer
Microsoft Access

There are also such thing as NoSQL database vendors such as:

MongoDB
Cassandra
ElasticSearch
Amazon DynamoDB
HBase
