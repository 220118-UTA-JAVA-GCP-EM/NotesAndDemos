# Jenkins

Jenkins is a self-contained, open source automation server, which can be used to automate the building, testing, and deployment of software.

It can installed standalone on a system, or work with tools like Docker

# Jenkins Projects, Jobs, and Builds

In Jenkins you work with Projects/Jobs:

-   Each job is a repeatable set of steps that automate a task
-   You can trigger your jobs manually, externally, or by other jobs
-   When a job is triggered, it create a build

Jobs have status called Health. The health is represented by a weather condition

-   Sunny: 81% or more build passed
-   Partially Sunny: 61 - 80% passed
-   Cloudy: 41 - 60% passed
-   Raining: 21 - 40% passed
-   Stormy: 20% or less passed

Builds have a more traditional status, each one gets a colored circle representing success or failure

-   Blue: success
-   Yellow: unstable
-   Red: Failure
-   Gray: No builds/aborted build

# Gradle Review

Gradle is fast, flexible, general purpose build tool that allows developers to build any software. It's task and plugin model allow developers to create custom workflows or use pre-canned workflows.

Gradle scripts are written in Groovey or Kotlin which gives full java API exposure to write tasks that can perform any OS task

Gradle builds consist of one or more projects. The definition of a project in Gradle is dependent on what Gradle is being used to do. A project could be building a JAR or other type of distributable, generating documentation, performing deployment process, etc.

The work that is done in a project is performed by one or more task. A task is a single, atomic unit of work which a build performs. A task would be a single step in a project like compile classes or run unit tests or build jar.

A script is file that the Gradle daemon looks for in the current directory. By default all Gradle configured directories have a file name `build.gradle` which is the script or build configuration script.

# Executing a sample Gradle build

1. SSH into the VM instance which should already have Docker installed

2. Run `docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 jenkins/jenkins`

3. Get the jenkins password `docker exec -t -i happy_carson cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword`

Go to INSTANCEIP:8080

4. Put in the password then setup jenkins

-   Choose install sugested plugins
-   Skip and continue as admin
-   Not now
-   Start using Jenkins

5. Create you first job

-   New Item
-   Name the build > FreeStyle Project > OK
-   Fill out the description
-   Talk through the different settings
-   Click on Build > Execute shell > echo something ls printenv
-   Apply
-   Click schedule build
-   Look at the build
-   Break the build a few times

6. Create a build triggered by build 1

-   New Item
-   Name the build > FreeStyle Project > OK
-   Go to build triggers > Build after other projects are built > Type in the name of the first job > Choose which ever option
-   Add a Build Step > Execute shell > echo I was called
-   Click save
-   Run the first project, and see that the second one is in the queue

7. Create a Github pipeline

-   Using the repo we have been using in training for SchoolManagmentBoot go to Webhooks > Add Webhook

-   Set payload URL to http://GCPIP:8080/github-webhook/

-   Set the content type to application/json

-   Choose `Let me select individual events`

    -   Pull Requests, Pushes

-   Add Webhook

-   If the delivery fails, try to fix the issue and redeliver

-   Back to Jenkins, New Item > Name it > Free Style Project > OK

-   Description > Can be literally anything

-   Source Code Management > Git > Paste the URL to the Repo

-   Branches to Build > \*/main

-   Build triggers > Github hook trigger for GitScm polling

-   Build > Add Build Step > Execute Shell

8. Setting up the Execute Shell

-   Start with `ls` to see the package structure from github

-   ```
    ls
    chmod 777 gradlew
    ./gradlew build
    ```

9. After the build succeeds we will put the project on the compute engine instance, since our docker container should be just for running jenkins

- Run `docker exec -t -i mycontainer /bin/bash` to explore the file system of our container

- Run  `docker cp busy_hellman:/var/jenkins_home/workspace/Speedrun ~/demo`

10. Now we should be able to run our application with

- Update the Dockerfile for java 11 since thats what gradlew for somereason compiles our classes in
    ```
    FROM openjdk:11
    COPY app/build/libs/app.jar demo.jar
    CMD ["java", "-jar", "demo.jar"]
    ```

-   `docker build -t sms .`

-   `docker run -d -p 7000:7000 -e DB_URL=34.121.69.220 -e DB_USERNAME=rootuser -e DB_PASSWORD=password sms`
