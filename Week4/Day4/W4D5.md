# SonarCloud setup & reports

A cloud based code review solution which can be configured to review code within a cloud repositoy, such as Github.

## Setup

1. Go to https://sonarcloud.io/login

2. Sign in with your github

3. Click on the Plus icon and choose `Analyze New Project`

4. Choose our Class Organization, and the SchoolManagementSystem repo > Click install

5. Create a key and click continue

6. Choose Free plan

7. Analyze Projects, Select the project we just imported

8. Under configure we will follow the directions

-   Paste the information into the gradle.build
-   create a .github/workflows directory with a file called build.yml

9. Paste this into build.yml

```name: Build
name: Build
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]
jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0  # Shallow clones should be disabled for a better relevancy of analysis
      - name: Set up JDK 11
        uses: actions/setup-java@v1
        with:
          java-version: 11

          restore-keys: ${{ runner.os }}-gradle
      - name: Build and analyze
        env:

          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}  # Needed to get PR information, if any

# SonarQube Quality Model

The SonarQube Quality Model has four different types of rules:

-   Reliability (bug)
-   Maintainability (code smell)
-   Security
    -   vulnerability
    -   hotspot

# Sonar Security Injection/Configuration rules

Security-injection rules: there is a vulnerability here when the inputs handled by your application are controlled by a user (potentially an attacker) and not validated or sanitized, when this occurs, the flow from sources (user-controlled inputs) to sinks (sensitive functions) will be presented. To do this, SonarQube uses well-known taint analysis technology on source code which allows, for example, the detection of:

-   CWE-89: SQL Injection
-   CWE-79: Cross-site Scripting
-   CWE-94: Code Injection

Security-configuration rules: here there is a security issue because the wrong parameter (eg: invalid cryptographic algorithm or TLS version) when calling a sensitive function has been set or when a check (eg: check_permissions() kind of function) was not done or not in the correct order, this problem is likely to appear often when the program is executed (no injected/complex attacks are required unlike in the previous category):

-   CWE-1004: Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag
-   CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch
-   CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
