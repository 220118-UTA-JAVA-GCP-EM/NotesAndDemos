# GCP - Compute Engine

Service that delivers scalable, high performance, Virtual Machines that run in Google’s data centers

-   A Virtual Machine (VM) creates isolated processes and provides virtualization so that processes can run in their own “sandbox” environment on the host machine
-   Provides a full operating system on your local machine, or in this case, a full operating system on googles machine, that we can access from our machine

We use Google Cloud Compute Engine because:

-   We developers probably can’t afford to build and host our own data centers to run machines off of.
-   We can move resources onto our VMs on the cloud in order to use/access them from multiple different places

GCP allows you to choose from various different machine via predefined or custom machine types

There are many general purpose machines for applicataions, databases, servers, and more

# Persistent Disk

Google Cloud Persistent Disks provide virtual instances with the storage capabilities those instances need to operate. The level of flexibility and configuration options available make Persistent Disk a very accessible cloud storage service for customers new to cloud computing.

There are three types of persistent disks to choose from:

-   Stardard: disks for workloads that primarily use sequential I/O
-   SSD: for enhanced performance and single digit milisecond latency
-   Local SSD's: for even lower latencies but without redundancy capabilities and availability bound to the instance lifetime

# Security Groups

## GCP uses Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) firewall rules that you can apply to your VM instances.

## VPC firewall rules

let you allow or deny connections to or from your virtual machine (VM) instances based on a configuration that you specify. Enabled VPC firewall rules are always enforced, protecting your instances regardless of their configuration and operating system, even if they have not started up.

Every VPC network functions as a distributed firewall. While firewall rules are defined at the network level, connections are allowed or denied on a per-instance basis. You can think of the VPC firewall rules as existing not only between your instances and other networks, but also between individual instances within the same network.

# Create an Instance and SSH

1. Go to Compute Engine from the navigation menu

2. Choose the following settings:

    - Which ever zone is closest to you
    - Machine Family: General Purpose
    - Machine Type: N1 Standard
    - BootDisk: Container-Optimized OS 81-12871.1317.7 LTS
        - This will auto install docker for us making our lives easier later on
    - Firewall: HTTP traffic and HTTP traffic
    - Network: Add http-server, https-server to Network tags
    - Security: Block project wide ssh keys

3. Hit create and let it do its thing

4. Create a new firewall rule with the following:

    - Network, priority, direction of traffic, action on match, target, 1000, ingress, allow and specified target tags should all be default values
    - For Target Tags: http-server, https-server
    - For Source Filter: 0.0.0.0/0
    - For Protocols and ports: all (not exactly secure, but it will help us not run into headaches later)

5. Click on SSH next to the name of the instance and it will log you into the engine
