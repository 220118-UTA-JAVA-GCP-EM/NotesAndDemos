# Intro to GCP Cloud Storage

GCP Cloud storage is a service that lets you store objects in google cloud

-   An object is an immutable piece of data of any kind of file or format

Objects are stored in containers called buckets

When you create a project with GCP, you can create Cloud Storage buckets, upload objects to your buckets, and download objects from your bucket. You can also grant permissions to make your data accessible to members, or accessible to everyone on the public internet

We will be using Cloud storage to demonstrate how to host public websites on the internet

## Bucket Setup Steps

1. Name your bucket
2. Choose "region" storage and any region outside of northern virginia
3. Choose "archive" storage for data we don't plan to access often
4. Uncheck "enforce public access prevention" so that we can actually access our object on the web
5. Create

# Hosting static sites on Firebase

1. Click on upload files, and shoose the HTML file you'd like to upload
2. Click on the newly uploaded file and click on the authenticated URL

# Session Management:

## Cookies

Cookies are key-value pairs of information sent by the server to the client, which the client stores

-   then you send the cookie in the HTTP request header

The servlet can the check for the presence of the cookie, most likely to get session information

There are two types of cookies:

-   Non-persistent: a cookie that expires when the user closes the browser
-   Persistent: a cookie that only expires if the user logs out of the website, it is stored even after the browser is closed

To set up a cookie, you simply use document.cookie = `the cookie`

We need to be careful what we store inside of the cookies, because attackers can use cross site scripting to see the information inside of cookies

Also keep in mind that we can only use cookies on files being hosted by a server

## HTTP Session API

Http Session API is a way to identify a user and store information about them based on their http requests

Sessions also require that you be hosting your static files on a server

You can manage these sessions nicely (kinda) with Javalin

1. You can  use the context from the http handler to create key/value session pairs

    - `context.req.sessionAttribute("key", "value")`

2. You can retrieve these attributes from the session with

    - `context.req.getSession().sessionAttribute("key")`

3. To remove a session attribute/invalidate you use
    - `context.req.getSession().invalidate()`

# Websockets

Websockets provide us with a full-duplex communication channel over a single TCP connection.

The idea is that once you connect, you will no longer have to send requests, you will just automatically recieve any message sent across the channel

The websocket connection stays open, which greatly reduces latency and complexity, these are great for things like realtime chatting applications
