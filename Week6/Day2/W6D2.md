# Spring Boot Introduction

Spring Boot is an open source Spring Framework project used to rapidly create Java based production grade applications utilizing Spring framewoeks IOC and module integrations

Spring Boot simplifies project creation because it allows you to pick and choose which Spring frameworks you want to use, and configures them for you

Spring Boot has a built in Tomcat server, and you dont need to map any servlets for web applications

To enable auto configuration you just need to annotate your driver class with @SpringBootApplication

@SpringBootApplication is a combination of:

-   @SpringBootConfiguration
-   @EnabledAutoConfiguration
-   @ComponentScan

You can also override/customize configurations using the application.properties file

# MVC Architecture Review

Model View Controller Design Pattern, it is a pattern that is used to design user interfaces and structure applications

Model: used to represent the business later of the application, aka the data layer which defines the business logic of the system, and represents the state of the application

View: the presentation layer/ui of the application. It displays data that is fetched from the model layer by the controller

Controller: the link between the view and the model, it receives user requests from the view, talks to the model layer, and returns data to display on the view.

The advantage of breaking up our application like this, is that multiple developers can be working on each independently of each other

It also enables logical grouping of related actions on a controller together

# Spring MVC

Spring MVC is a request driven structure centered around a central Servlet using the front controller design pattern

Servlets are the underlying technology that allows Java to interface between clients through the internet

## Front Controller Design Pattern

The front controller design pattern provides a single handler for all incoming requests for a resource in an application, then dispatches the requests to the appropriate secondary handler for that type of request.

It uses a helper api to achieve the dispatching mechanism, it is broken up into four differen components

Front controller is the single point of entry for requests, it directs requests to the dispatcher

Dispatcher is reposponsible for managing the actions and the views, including locating and routing to specific actions that will service a request, and finding the correct view

Helper classes are used to break up the logic of specific features, and makes the program easier to build and maintaine

Views represent and display information that we want to display to the client

The Spring DispatchServlet is completely integrated with the Spring IOC container

The Dispatch Servlet routes requests to handlers, view resolvers, and also provides support for uploading files

Since DispatchServlet is a servlet itself it must map it in the web.xml

View Resolvers will retrieve the correct view from controller

# InternalViewResorceResolver

The InternalResourceView is a Wrapper class for JSP or other resources within the same web application. It can be used to expose model objects as request attributes and forward requests to a specified resource URL using the RequestDispatcher. In particular the InteralResourceViewResolver supports definitions for InternalResourceViews for a simple and straightforward resolution of @Controller class methods.

# Spring MVC Annotations

## @Controller:

will mark the class as a controller, which is a special kind of spring bean that handles requests, the dispatcher will scan for these classes, and send requests to the correct controller

## @RequestMapping:

used to map a uri to a specific class, or to a specific method inside of a controller, you can also include the http method if it is over a method

## @RequestBody:

use this annotation to gain access to the object sent with the request

## @ResponseBody:

this annotation will automatically convert the return of the method to the correct json object to send in the response back to the client

## @RestController:

a class level annotation that combines @RequestMapping and @ResponseBody, allows you to return from the controller methods normally, without a ResponseBody annotation

We will be seeing these annotations again once we get into SpringBoot

## Path Paremeters and Query Parameters

Path Parameters and Query Parameters are ways to send information to the server without using a POST request, these should only be used to send information that is none confidential. To set these up you use the @RequestParam and @PathVariable in the method parameters

Path Variable allows you to add a value after the last slash of the request uri, ex `http://url/get/variable`

Query Parameters use a ? in the uri then you define the parameters you are sending over, ex `http:url/get?var=name`

# Object Relational Mapping (ORM):

ORM's convert the data between relational databases and object oriented programming langauages

-   Essentially turn Java objects, into an entry in a database table for us

Most object-oriented application store data in relational databaes which use tables, while the application classes create objects, in order to get data from one to another we must do some conversion

Benefits of ORM's:

-   ORM's map an object to the table for you
-   we can hide the details of SQL queries from OO logic, this propagates the idea of data abstraction
-   it provides methods for automatic versioning and time stamping
-   it provides caching for better performance
-   best suited for large projects
-   injected transaction management
-   configurable logging
-   faster development of applications

There are lots of ORM's available, including Hibernate, JPA, Active JOA, iBATIS, IBM Pure Query and more

## Hibernate

Hibernate is an ORM tool for Java programming

-   It is flexible and powerful ORM solution to map Java classes to database tables
-   It is an implementation or JPA, so it follows the standards provided by JPA
-   It is defined under the org.hibernate
-   It uses the Hibernate Query Language which is similar to JPQL
-   Hibernate session interface is an extension to JPA's EntityManager

## Hibernate Annotations

Hibernate adds functionality to the Java Persistence API annotations, so we will be using the JPA annotations for Hibernate

@Entity denotes the java object is going to be stored in the database

@Table allows you to set information about the table that will be created based on the entity

@Column marks a field in your java class as a column in a database table

@Id marks the field as the primary id of your database table

@ManyToMany is used to create a junction table between two classes in java

@ManyToOne is used to create a many to one relationship between two classes in java

@OneToMany is used to create a one to many relationship between two classes in java

## Hibernate Mapping classes

You first must setup a hibernate configuration this is stored in the hibernate.cfg.xml, you set the following properties
- hibernate.dialect
- hibernate.connection.driver_class
- hibernate.connection.url
- hibernate.connection.username
- hibernate.password
- hibernate.pool.size
- use_sql_comments
- hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto

Then you create classes as you would normally, but map then to a database table with the hibernate annotations

Use hibernate sessions to make connections to your database and make queries
