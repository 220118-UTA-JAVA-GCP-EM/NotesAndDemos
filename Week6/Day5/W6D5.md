# Overview of AOP and Cross Cutting Concerns

AOP stands for Aspect Oriented Programming, instead of concerning ourselves with objects, we focus on Aspects, which modularize particular concerns which can present across multiple classes, known as cross cutting concerns

Examples:
- Database access
- Data entities
- error handling
- logging

AOP and Cross Cutting Concerns help reduce code redundancy by transfering responsibility of these problems to aspects

## AOP Terminology

Aspect: a representation of a concern which cuts across multiple classes

Weaving: the process of linking aspects with other objects, such as beans, to create advised objects. This can be done at compile time (such as when using the AspectJ compiler), load time or runtime. Spring performs weaving at runtime

Join Point: a specific moment during executing of a program, such as the invocation of a method, where an action takes place

Advice: action taken by an aspect at a specific join point

Pointcut: a definition of which methods our application advice ought to be into or around, for example when a method of a certain name is executed. By defualt, spring used AspectJ pointcut expression language

Introduction: declaration of new interfaces and corresponding implementations in subclasses of any advised object. Introductions use the `@DeclareParents` annotation with the defaultImpl attribute to define a concrete class for the bean definition

# AspectJ

@AspectJ refers to a style of declaring aspects through the use of regular Java classes with annotations. @AspectJ style was introduced in AspectJ 5 release of the AspectJ project. Note that Spring interprets the same annotations as AspectJ 5, using a library supplied by AspectJ, however Spring AOP's runtime is not dependent on the AspectJ compiler or weaver

To utilize AspectJ aspects in a Spring configuration, you need to enable support for configuring the Spring AOP based AspectJ aspects and autoproxying beans which are advised by those aspects.

Autoproxying means that spring will automatically generate a proxy to interpret method invocations when a bean is advised by one or more apsects to ensure the advise is executed

AspectJ configurations can be enabled using either XML or Java-based spring configureation. In either case, you will need to make sure that the AspectJ aspectweaver.jar is in your applications classpath
(version 1.6.8 or later is required for Spring 4.0.x+)

# Spring AOP:
the spring module that utilizes AspectJ to easily implement AOP principles in Java

# Cross Cutting Concerns:
parts of a program that rely on, or must affect many other part of the system

# Advice:

Like mentioned above, advice is a specific action taken, defined as a method, at a particular point during execution of a program

There are 5 types of advice:

- Before: advice that will execute before a join point, but does not have the capability to halt the normal execution of the proceeding join point (unless an exception is thrown)
- After Returning: advice that will execute after a join point completes without throwing an exception
- After Throwing: advice that will execute after a join point throws an exception
- After: Advice that will execution regardless of the outcome of the join point
- Around: Advice that will execute before and after the join point. It is the most general, but also the most powerful. It can perform custom behavior before and after a join point, and can be responisble for choosing whether or not to proceed to the join point.

In general, it is recommended to use the least powerful type of advice for any particular task. For instance, if you only need to update a cache with a value returned from a method, it is best to use the After Returning advice

# Pointcut and JointPoints

Pointcuts determine Joinpoints, because they define which methods in out application ought to be injected into or around

Joinpoints are the specific moment during execution of a program in which the advice is taken

Pointcuts are comprised of a name, and any parameters, and keep in mind these determine EXACTLY which method execution we are interested in

To create a pointcut we use @Pointcut annotation with regular method signatures, these include:

- execution
- within
- this
- target
- args
- @target
- @args
- @within
- @annotation

Execution is the most widely used, and you can use patterns with wildcard to specify the join points

```java
execution(?modifiers-pattern ret-type-patter ?declaring-type-pattern name-pattern(param-pattern) ?throws pattern)
```

# Pub/Sub Design Pattern

The pub/sub messaging model allows a message producer (also called a publisher) to broadcast a message to one or more consumers (called subscribers). Publisher and Subscribers exchange means through an intermediary channel called as topic. Publishers produce messages to a topic and Subscribers subscribe to a topic and consume messages from a topic. Publishers doesn't have the knowledge about the subscribers.

A publisher creates and sends messages to a topic. Subscribers subscribe to a topic, to receive messages from it. Communication can be one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many.

## Pub/Sub Use Cases

Publisher Subscriber is commonly used with things like Microservices to orchestraight things like:

-   Real-time event distribution
-   Replicating data among databases
-   Parallel processing and workflows
-   Enterprise event bus
-   Data streaming from IoT devices
-   Refreshing distributed caches
-   Load balancing for reliability

## Asynchronous Processing Mindset

We already talked about asynchronous programming when we learned about Javascript

Asynchronous means that we are able to move on from some function/method call, and continue while it processes. The Pub/sub pattern plays well with this mindset. You set up your application to consume messages from the queue whenever something new comes up, then it continues processing whatever it was before the new message came in.

# Messaging Queues

A message queue is a software component used for passing data (messages) between services. It exposes an interface for adding, reading, and removing messages. Generally speaking, messages are persisted.

Message queues facilitate asynchronous communication between discrete services. There can be multiple **producers** (services adding messages to the queue) and
**consumers** (services taking messages from the queue). The producers and consumers are decoupled in time and space; a producer need not know when or by whom a message will be consumed. This feature has the following benefits:

-   **Resiliency** - Isolated failures stay isolated. A consumer can go down temporarily and begin processing messages when it comes back online, without affecting other services.
-   **Scalability** - To increase the rate at which messages are added or processed, simply add more producers or consumers.
-   **Visibility** - Examining the queue itself can provide valuable insight into the health of an application.

## Messaging Queues Vendors

Examples of Message Queues:

-   [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/)
-   [Amazon SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/)
-   [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/)

We wil be taking a look at RabbitMQ

# RabbitMQ Demo

We must first download and setup the RabbitMQ server

-   We will be using a tech called Docker, we will learn more about docker next week
-   With docker to create a RabbitMQ server you simply have to run these commands in a terminal
    -   `docker pull rabbitmq:3.9-management`
    -   `winpty -Xallow-non-tty docker run --rm -it -p 15672:15672 -p 5672:5672 rabbitmq:3.9-management`

We can visit http://localhost:15672

-   default username and password are guest

Now we can setup our producers and consumers in the spring project

# Microservices Architecture overview

## What are Microservices

Microservices are small, autonomous services that work together

In microservice architecture, we divide the application into services. Each service does specific business logic, and has its own database.

You essentially create mutliple Java appliations that serve a specific purpose, and each of these communicate to create a more complicated system.

![arch](microservice.png)

Microservice Architecture gises us a more decentralized approach for building software, which also scales well, and as greater agilty

Netflix popularized the Microservice Architecture, and created their own API to handle their Microservices, these were used by developers everywhere, but is slowly being phased out by newer API's

## Characteristics and Challenges of MSA

Characteristics of MSA:

-   Break our application into mutliple individually deployable components, should be independently replaceable, and upgradable
-   Services should be organized by business logic
-   Provides infrastructure automation with continuous delivery and automated testing
-   Service failures should be isolated, failure of one service should not take down the entire app

Challenges:

-   Finding the concrete boundries between services
-   Finding a root cause of an issue
-   Version management
-   Logging is distributed between services
-   An issue caused by one service can cause trouble elsewhere

## Advantages/Disadvantages

Adavantages:

-   Microservices follow the [Single Responsibility Principle](https://deviq.com/single-responsibility-principle/).
-   Fault isolation - If one service crashes, itâ€™s quite possible the rest of the application can continue to operate until that service recovers.
-   Microservices are language and platform independent.
-   Dynamic scaling - we can dynamically scale up/down the service instances whenever required.
-   Developers have the freedom to develop and deploy services independently.
-   Use of containers allowing for a quick deployment and development of the application.

Disadvantages:

-   Microservice architecture is complex.
-   Harder to test and monitor because of the complexity of the architecture.
-   Large numbers of microservices are harder to manage and secure.

## MSA vs Monolithic

| Hard to scale or upgrade.                                                                                         | Easy to scale and upgrade.                                                                                                                 |
| Less expensive and faster to develop.                                                                             | More expensive and takes more time to develop.                                                                                             |
| Monolithic uses a shared database.                                                                                | Each microservice uses a single database. Each service can use any database system (MySQL, Oracle, NoSQL) depending on its business logic. |
| Monolithic applications are tightly coupled. Here, it is difficult to change technology or language or framework. | MSA ensures that the services are loosely coupled, so it's easy to make changes since services are independent to each other.              |
| The entire system can be affected by a single error or bug.                                                       | The entire system is shielded from the error or bug on one microservice.                                                                   |
