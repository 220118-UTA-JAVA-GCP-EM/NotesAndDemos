# Webservices

A webservice is a software that allows machines to exchange and make use of information over a network

These services must comply to a set of standards, and be exposed via a consumable API

Two types of webservices

-   REST
-   SOAP

Advantages of Web Services:

-   We can use the web as a transactional tool, rather than simply to display data
-   Expose functionality of a business service both within and outside of your application, making your functionality reusable by others
-   Captialize on existing standards, creating standardization
-   Hardware and OS independent
-   Loose coupling of programs

## History of web services - SOAP vs REST

# Rest vs Soap

## REST

Rest stands for Representational State Transfer

Rest is an architectural style that outlines communication between a client and a server

The outline is a set of guides for developing a web server

To be considered RESTful the webservice in question must follow these 6 constraints

-   Uniform interface: the service must adhere to a commonly decided API standard:
    -   Indetification of resources: the URL
    -   Manipulation of resources through representations: a request yields the state of a resource
    -   Self-descriptive messages
    -   Hypermedia as the engine of application state
-   Client-Server: separation of concerns
-   Stateless: The server should not retain ant information about the clients session
-   Cacheable: Responses should be explicitly labeled as cacheable or not
-   Layered System: The system should be organized into layers such that components can only communicte with components that are part of the same layer
-   Code On Demand: an optional constraint that allows executable code or scripts to be sent with responses

Resources in REST is any information that can be named

We typically represent these resources with some standard such as JSON or XML

To identify resources with a RESTful service we use URL's (Unified Resource Locator), this is called the resource identifier

RESTful services should have uniform resource indentifiers, so here are some rules you can follow to conform to this

-   use nouns to name resources
-   begin your uri the plural collection of a particular resource
-   use path parameters to identify a single resource in a specific document/record
-   capitalize on path structure to represent heirarchy
-   Identify stores of resources that are managed by the client (sub-collections)
-   use query parameters to filter resources of a particular type
-   be consistant accross the board

REST best practices:

-   Consumer First

## Rest Content Negotiation

Content Negotiatation is the process of selecting the best representation for a given response when there are multiple representations avabailable

This is done on the serverside based on the media type in the request header

You can do this by either setting the Content-Type of the the request header to a specified type, the server can also read the ACCEPT attribute of the header to read what kind of data the client wants

You can also do this with URL patterns, include the specified content type extension in the URL of the request

## Richardson Maturity Model

This is a model that breaks down the principal elements of a REST approach into three steps

0. Start with HTTP
    - Interactions for your application are built on HTTP, with some kind of payload
1. Introduce Resources
    - API endpoints will be directed a particular resources
2. Verbs of HTTP
    - Tie the actions taken as closely as possible with the verbs of HTTP
3. HyperMedia Controls
    - The point of hypermedia controls is that they tell us what we can do next, and the URI of the resource we need to manipulate to do it

## SOAP

SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol, its is a contract based protocol for sending information

The specifications for SOAP outline a distributed processing model

-   Components in the SOAP model are nodes, and they send messages back and forth

SOAP based webservices are split into providers, requesters, and registry

Providers perform some particular service, and communicate to the requester via SOAP message

Requesters are the comsumers, they utilize some service, they utilize the web service description in order to interface with the provider

Registry is a centralized location to which providers publish their services

The Web Service Descriptor is a document that forms a contract between a provider and a requester, it is written in a specific form of XML called WSDL (Web Service Description Language)

Two versions of the WSDL, 1.1 and 2.0

WSDL 2.0 elements:

-   `<description>` the root of any WSDL
-   `<types>` data types used for messaging in the web service
-   `<interface>` responsible for specifying how an operation relates to its messages and how the messages relate to their datatypes
-   `<binding>` decides the protocol and format for each of the actions in the portType element
-   `<service>` contains endpoints as sub-elements

There are two ways to create a SOAP service:

-   Contract first: you write the WSDL then make the code conform
-   Contract last: you write the code then make the WSDL conform

SOAP messages are an XML document that have a particular form, each message has:

-   `<envolope>` the root
-   `<header>` optional sub-element of the envolope
-   `<body>` contains the core infor of the message
-   `<fault>` used for error reporting

# REST and SOAP Differences

| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| SOAP is a protocol.                                         | REST is an architectural style.                                                                  |
| SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol.              | REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer.                                                 |
| SOAP can't use REST because it is a protocol.               | REST can use SOAP web services because it is a concept and can use any protocol like HTTP, SOAP. |
| SOAP uses services interfaces to expose the business logic. | REST uses URI to expose business logic.                                                          |
| JAX-WS is the java API for SOAP web services.               | JAX-RS is the java API for RESTful web services.                                                 |
| SOAP defines standards to be strictly followed.             | REST does not define too much standards like SOAP.                                               |
| SOAP requires more bandwidth and resource than REST.        | REST requires less bandwidth and resource than SOAP.                                             |
| SOAP defines its own security.                              | RESTful web services inherits security measures from the underlying transport.                   |
| SOAP permits XML data format only.                          | REST permits different data format such as Plain text, HTML, XML, JSON etc.                      |
| SOAP is less preferred than REST.                           | REST more preferred than SOAP.                                                                   |

# Using Angular to consume web services

This is the same as how we made http requests last week

# Using RestTemplate to consume web services

RestTemplate is used to make web requests with a Java/Spring application.

RestTemplate acts as a webclient to makes request to webservices, it offers three different methods of exchanging data with a web service

-   getForEntity()
-   getForObject()
-   exchange()

# Spring Boot DevTools

Spring Boot DevTools implements two useful features

-   Cache Disabling: cache is helpful in prodiction, but can hinder development workflow, DevTools automatically diables caching
-   Automatic Restarts: anytime you make a change to your application, developement will server will restart automatically

# Spring Boot Actuator

Spring Boot Actuator is a Spring Library that exposes tools for monitoring and gatering metric about a running application

You can utilize Actuators predefined endpoints to view different information about your application:

-   /health: shows the applications health
-   /beans: shows a list of available beans in the BeanFactory
-   /env: return the current application properties
-   /info: return general data, this can be customized
-   /logfile: return the content of the logfile
-   /loggers: show or modify logger configurations
-   /mapping: show all @RequestMappings
-   /metrics: show metric information about the application
-   /shutdown: shutdown the application

In the application.properties you can turn on or off specific endpoints

# Dynamic Environment Configuration - Spring Boot Profiles

Allows us to map beans to different profiles, allowing us to have different versions of our beans

-   different database connections for different environments

This allows for best practices of separating your working environments, from development, testing, and production

To map a bean to a specific profile/environment, simply annotate the bean class with `@Profile("environmentName")`

To set the active profile simply set it in the application.properties with `spring.properties.active-'environment` value

You can also set dependencies for Spring based on the environment in the application.properties:

```
# properties for all profiles
---
spring:
  profiles:
    - dev
  # properties for dev environment
---
spring:
  profiles:
    - prod
  # properties for prod environment
```
